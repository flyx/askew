<h1>Askew</h1>
<p align="center">A minimal framework for writing dynamic websites in pure Go</p>

---

**Askew** is a framework that assists you in using [Go](https://golang.org) for the client-side code of your website.
It is primarily a code generator which reads in annotated HTML code and snippets, and outputs a Go API to the website structure described in that annotated HTML.

For using Go in the browser, you need to compile your code with either [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) or Go's native [WASM](https://webassembly.org) target.

Askew's philosophy is to hide the DOM from the code by default and require annotations to expose certain parts of it, so that it can be read and/or manipulated from inside your code.
The goal is to improve *maintainability* of your code by explicitly stating which parts of your HTML can be modified at runtime.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/flyx/askew
```

You need at least Go 1.12 since Askew uses Go modules.

## Usage

You specify your HTML components in `<name>.askew` files in your source tree, and the main HTML file in `<name>.asite`.
Askew will discover these files walking the directory structure of your module and for each `<name>.askew` file it will generate a `<name>.go` file.
If such a file already exists, it will be replaced if and only if its first line is

    // generated by askew. do not modify.

This way, it protects you from acidentally overwriting your precious code.

`.askew` files can depend on each other but must all be contained in the same module.
The `.asite` file will generate an `index.html` file, which will be the entry point to your website.

The `askew` command line tool takes the following parameters:

    askew [options] [dir]

Possible options are

 * `-o path`, `--outputDir=path`: Specify the directory where the `index.html` file should be placed. Defaults to the current directory.

The `dir` parameter must be a path to a directory containing a Go module or a subdirectory thereof.
If left out, the current directory is used.

The [documentation](/doc/concepts/) covers writing annotated HTML for Askew and advanced usage.
