# Template Based Components (TBC)

TBC is a tool for creating HTML in GopherJS.
You write HTML `<template>` nodes and TBC autogenerates Go types from them that can be used to instantiate the template.
The Go types let you access and alter dynamic content and handle events generated by the instantiated HTML.

TBC is an unopinionated library and doesn't care how your HTML looks, how you communicate with a server, what database you use etc.
Its sole purpose is to relieve you from the burden of having to deal with the DOM API.

TBC is written for browsers that support the `<template>` and `<slot>` elements.
If yours doesn't, tough luck.
